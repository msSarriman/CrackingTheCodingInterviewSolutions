/**
 * Stack of Plates: Imagine a (literal) stack of plates. If the stack gets too high, it might topple.
 * Therefore, in real life, we would likely start a new stack when the previous stack exceeds some
 * threshold. Implement a data structure SetOfStacks that mimics this. SetOfStacks should be
 * composed of several stacks and should create a new stack once the previous one exceeds capacity.
 * SetOfStacks. push () and SetOfStacks. pop () should behave identically to a single stack
 * (that is, pop ( ) should return the same values as it would if there were just a single stack).
 * FOLLOW UP
 * Implement afunction popAt (int index) which performs a pop operation on aspecific sub-stack.
 * Hints: #64, #87
