/**
 * Binary to String: Given a real number between 0 and 1 (e.g., 0.72) that is passed in as a double, print
 * the binary representation. If the number cannot be represented accurately in binary with at most 32
 * characters, print "ERROR:'
 * Hints: #143, #167, #173, #269, #297
 * - To wrap your head around the problem, try thinking about how you'd do it for integers
 * - In a number like. 893 (in base 10), what does each digit signify? What then does each
 * digit in .10010 signify in base 2?
 * - A number such as .893 (in base 10) indicates 8 * 10-1 + 9 * 10-2 + 3 * 10-3â€¢
 * Translate this system into base 2.
 * - How would you get the first digit in . 893? If you multiplied by 10, you'd shift the values
 * over to get 8.93.What happens if you multiply by 2?
 * - Think about what happens for values that can't be represented accurately in binary
