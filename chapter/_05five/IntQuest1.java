/**
 * Insertion: You are given two 32-bit numbers, N and M, and two bit positions, i and
 * j. Write a method to insert M into N such that M starts at bit j and ends at bit i. You
 * can assume that the bits j through i have enough space to fit all of M. That is, if
 * M = 10011, you can assume that there are at least 5 bits between j and i. You would not, for
 * example, have j = 3 and i = 2, because M could not fully fit between bit 3 and bit 2.
 * EXAMPLE
 * Input: N 10000000000, Îœ = 10011, i 2, j 6
 * Output: N 10001001100
 * Hints: # 137, #169, #215
 * - Break this into parts. Focus first on clearing the appropriate bits
 * - To clear the bits, create a "bit mask"that looks like a series of 1s, then Os, then 1s
 * - It's easy to create a bit mask of Os at the beginning or end. But how do you create a bit
 * mask with a bunch of zeroes in the middle? Do it the easy way: Create a bit mask for the
 * left side and then another one for the right side.Then you can merge those.
