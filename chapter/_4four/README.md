Chapter 4, problems:
------------

* 1: Route Between Nodes: Given a directed graph, design an algorithm to find out whether there is a
     route between two nodes.
* 2: Minimal Tree: Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create 
     a binary search tree with minimal height.
* 3: List of Depths: Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes
     at each depth (e.g., if you have a tree with depth 0, you'll have 0 linked lists).
* 4: Check Balanced: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of
     this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any
     node never differ by more than one.
* 5: Validate BST: Implement a function to check if a binary tree is a binary search tree.
